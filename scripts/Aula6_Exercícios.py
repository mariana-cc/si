# Aula 6 - não foi possível realizar os exercícios em Jupyter Notebook

# - Exercise: Test the object VotingClassifier using the breast-bin.csv dataset

# (1) Read csv file - breast-bin.csv
breast_file = "../datasets/breast-bin.csv"
breast = read_csv(filename=breast_file, sep=",", features=True, label=True)

# (2) Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
breast.X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(breast.X)

# (3) Split dataset in training and testing sets
breast_train, breast_test = train_test_split(breast)

# (4) Model KNNClassifier
knn = KNNClassifier(k=3, distance=euclidean_distance)

# (5) Logistic Regression
lr = LogisticRegression(l2_penalty= 1, alpha= 0.001, max_iter=2000)

# (6) Create VotingClassifier ensemble model using the previous classifiers
voting = VotingClassifier([knn, lr])

# (7) Train the model
voting.fit(breast_train)

# (8) What is the score obtained?
score = voting.score(breast_test)
print(f"The voting score is {score}")

# - Exercise 6: Test the object StackingClassifier using the breast-bin.csv dataset

# (1) Read csv file - breast-bin.csv
breast_file = "../datasets/breast-bin.csv"
breast = read_csv(filename=breast_file, sep=",", features=True, label=True)

# (2) Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
breast.X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(breast.X)

# (3) Split dataset in training and testing sets
breast_train, breast_test = train_test_split(breast)

# (4) Model KNNClassifier
knn = KNNClassifier(k=3, distance=euclidean_distance)

# (5) Logistic Regression
lr = LogisticRegression(l2_penalty= 1, alpha= 0.001, max_iter=2000)

# (6) Create final KNNClassifier model
knn_final = KNNClassifier(k=2, distance=euclidean_distance)

# (7) Create VotingClassifier ensemble model using the previous classifiers and using final model knn
stacking = StackingClassifier([lr, knn], knn_final)

# (7) Train the model
stacking.fit(breast_train)

# (8) What is the score obtained?
score = stacking.score(breast_test)
print(f"The stacking score is {score}")
